# Summer-Projects-2023
The following are some Machine Learning projects I made in the Summer of 2023, on Jupyter Notebook.

- **Movie Genre Classfication:**

This is a machine learning model which classifies movies given in the dataset into genres, based on the plot summary.

The datasets are given here: *https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JqCeA3RnDVQmFHgrTXjN1sQ-UBMecJHZ?usp=drive_link*

- **Credit Card Fraud Detection:**

This is a machine learning model which finds out fraudulent credit card transactions.

The main logic was to find the haversine distance between the merchant and the customer to find out which transactions are fraud.

- **Spam SMS Detection:**

This is a machine learning model which classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam) based on the text it contains.
